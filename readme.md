## Convolutional Neural Network with PyTorch

This project contains a convolutional neural network implemented using the PyTorch library.

## Dependencies

The project uses the following libraries:

- PyTorch: An open source machine learning framework. We use it to define and train the neural network.
- torchvision: A library for PyTorch that provides access to popular datasets, model architectures, and image transformations for computer vision.
- matplotlib: A plotting library for Python. We use it to graph data and loss curves.
- numpy: A library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

## Installation

You can install the dependencies with pip:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib numpy
